// Package protocol implements the wire format for meshTerm's mtRoam
// protocol over QUIC. See docs/mtroam-protocol.md.
//
// Three things live here:
//
//   - Constants — the ALPN string, frame size limits, error codes
//   - Typed message structs (Attach, AttachAck, Ack, Resize, Ping,
//     Pong, Goodbye) covering the control stream
//   - WriteFrame / ReadFrame — length-prefixed CBOR framing for the
//     control stream, plus the helpers that pack/unpack typed
//     messages
//
// The output stream's framing (`[uint64 seq][uint32 len][bytes]`) is
// in this package too, since it's a wire-level concern; the QUIC
// transport package reaches in for it.
//
// All structures use the field-name tags from docs/mtroam-protocol.md
// so the on-wire CBOR keys match the spec verbatim.
