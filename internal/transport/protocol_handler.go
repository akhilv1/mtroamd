//
// HandleConnection orchestrates the per-attach goroutines and waits
// for any of them to return before tearing down. The whole protocol
// runs on one client-initiated bidirectional stream: every frame is
// wrapped in a `[u8 type][u32 len][body]` tagged envelope, where
// type ∈ {control, stdin, stdout}. The Attach handshake is the
// first frame; AttachAck is the response.
//
// We use a single stream rather than QUIC multistream because iOS
// Network.framework's NWMultiplexGroup-based multistream API has
// proved unworkable: NWConnection(from: NWConnectionGroup) returns
// nil if called immediately after group.start, and the parent group
// never transitions to .ready without a child being opened first
// (chicken-and-egg). Type-tagged framing on a single bidi stream
// keeps the persistence + replay-on-reattach semantics intact
// without depending on Apple's multistream API.
